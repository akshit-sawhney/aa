2. The second best solution will receive an Amazon Kidnle

## Ok... But what am I supposed to do?
  - [ ] [COOL DRAW](#cool-draw)
  - [ ] [DISTANCE CALCULATOR](#distance-calculator)
  - [ ] [REPLAY](#replay)

## COOL DRAW
1. Implement a basic canvas
2. Implement the logic to draw lines on this canvas

## DISTANCE CALCULATOR
1. Implement a logic to calculate the amount of distance covered while drawing on the canvas.
2. Consider each pixel to be 1 meter.

## REPLAY
1. Implement a logic to replay the drawing events.
2. This should be time based. Supposed the second pixel was drawn on the canvas after 1 second of the first pixel drawn, then this should also be reflected in the replay as well.
2. Store the events in a way that you require the least amount of data to replay the whole drawing.
3. This data should be as compressed as possible.
4. The data should be as minimal as possible.
Ex: Suppose to draw an line, you used events in the following order
    1. mouseDown
    2. drag(s)
    3. mouseUp
Then you need to optimize the logic to make sure that this data is minimal

## Hmm... And how will you evaluate it?
1. The code quality.
2. The accuracy of the various logics involved.
3. The optimization of the logic to compress the data required to replay the session.

## But how will I submit my solution?
1. Raise a pull request (PR) for this repository
